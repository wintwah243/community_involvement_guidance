# Community Involvement Guidance 

Community Involvement Guidance is an intelligent AI model designed to generate structured step-by-step guidelines related to sustainable community development. It helps users get clear, actionable, and AI-generated guidelines based on user's area of interest and experienced level.
By analyzing a dataset of expert knowledge, the system generates step-by-step guidelines tailored to various topics and user levels.

## What problem it solves

According to survey data collected from university students, 70% of them are interested in community development but they are facing various challenges such as their professions feel unrelated to community development, not knowing how to start or not having clear starting point and step-by-step guidelines, and lacking a clear understanding of the UN SDG goals.
Therefore, we believe that our project can be a platform that creates a positive impact for the community and it can engage many young people from various academic backgrounds even without prior experience in the field and help build a better future together.
